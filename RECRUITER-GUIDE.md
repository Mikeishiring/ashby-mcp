## How To Talk To Your Assistant

### Just Be Natural! 🗣️

Your assistant understands conversational English. You don't need special commands or formats—just ask questions or make requests like you would with a coworker.

#### ✅ Good Examples

**Pipeline Checks:**
- "What's going on with the pipeline?"
- "Who needs my attention right now?"
- "Show me candidates stuck in interviews"

**Candidate Lookup:**
- "Find Sarah Chen"
- "Tell me about john@company.com"
- "What's the status of the Senior Engineer candidates?"

**Actions:**
- "Schedule an interview for Sarah on Friday at 2pm"
- "Move John to the Technical Interview stage"
- "Create an offer for Maria: $120k, starts next month"
- "Apply Alex to the Staff Engineer role too"
- "Tag this candidate as 'Senior Leadership'"

**Multi-Candidate Operations:**
- "Compare Sarah, John, and Maria for the Backend role"
- "Show me scorecards for the top candidates"
- "Apply Sarah to both Senior and Staff positions"

#### ❌ Don't Worry About Being Perfect

You don't need to remember exact names or IDs:
- "That engineer from Google" → The assistant will ask for clarification
- "The senior role" → It'll figure out which job you mean
- "john" → It'll search and show you matches
