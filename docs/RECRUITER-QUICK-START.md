# Ashby Assistant: Quick Start for Recruiters 🚀

**Get started in 5 minutes - no technical knowledge required**

---

## Step 1: What You'll See

Your Ashby assistant lives in a dedicated Slack channel (usually `#ashby-bot` or similar). When you message the bot, it responds just like a teammate would.

---

## Step 2: Try Your First Commands

### Say Hello
```
You: "Hi! What can you help me with?"
```

The bot will introduce itself and explain its capabilities.

### Check Your Pipeline
```
You: "Show me the pipeline overview"
```

You'll see a summary of candidates across all stages.

### Find a Candidate
```
You: "Find Sarah Chen"
```

Or search by email:
```
You: "Look up john@company.com"
```

---

## Step 3: Common Daily Tasks

### Morning Routine
```
1. "What candidates need my attention?"
2. "Show me stale candidates"
3. "What interviews are scheduled this week?"
```

### Working with Candidates
```
# Get details
"Tell me about Sarah Chen"

# See interview feedback
"Show me the scorecard for John Doe"

# Check history
"What's the timeline for this candidate?"
```

### Quick Actions
```
# Add a note
"Add note to Sarah: Impressive technical background"

# Move stage
"Move John to Technical Interview"

# Schedule interview
"Schedule Sarah for Tuesday at 2pm with Mike and Jane"
```

---

## Step 4: Multi-Role Hiring (NEW!)

### Apply to Multiple Jobs
```
"Apply Sarah to both the Senior Engineer and Staff Engineer roles"
```

The bot will create a second application without affecting the first one.

### Transfer Between Roles
```
"John is a better fit for the Backend role - transfer his application"
```

### See Who's Involved
```
"Who's on the hiring team for this candidate?"
```

---

## Step 5: Stay Organized

### Tag Candidates
```
# See available tags
"What tags do we have?"

# Tag someone
"Tag Maria as 'Python Developer'"
```

### Track Sources
```
"Where are our candidates coming from?"
"Show me source analytics"
```

---

## Important Things to Know

### ✅ Confirmations
The bot will ask you to confirm before making changes:
```
Bot: "I'm about to schedule an interview for Sarah on Friday at 2pm with Mike.
     React with ✅ to confirm."

You: ✅ (react to the message)
```

### 📧 Always Include Emails
The bot will show candidate emails to avoid confusion:
```
Bot: "Found *Sarah Chen* (sarah@email.com) - currently in Technical Interview"
```

### ⏰ Stale = 14+ Days
When the bot mentions "stale candidates," it means they've been in a stage for more than 14 days (except Application Review, which is expected to be slow).

### 🔒 Privacy
Once someone is marked as "Hired" in Ashby, the bot can't access their information anymore (privacy rules).

## Pro Tips

### 1. Be Conversational
You don't need formal commands. These all work:
- "What's up with the pipeline?"
- "Pipeline status please"
- "Show me how things are looking"

### 2. Don't Worry About Names
If you're not sure of the exact name:
- "That engineer from Google" → Bot will help you find them
- "john" → Bot will show you all matching Johns

### 3. Ask for Comparisons
```
"Compare the top 3 candidates for Senior Engineer"
"Who are the strongest candidates right now?"
```

### 4. Get Proactive Suggestions
```
You: "Tell me about Sarah Chen"

Bot: "Sarah is in Technical Interview for 12 days. She has completed
     2/3 interview rounds with great feedback (4.5/5 average). The
     final interview isn't scheduled yet. Want me to schedule it?"
```

### 5. Batch Operations
```
"Apply Sarah to Senior Engineer, Staff Engineer, and Principal roles"
```

---

## Need Help?

### In Slack
```
"What can you do?"
"Help me with interviews"
"How do I create an offer?"
```

The bot will explain exactly what it can help with.

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I schedule multiple interviews at once?**
A: Yes! Just list them: "Schedule interviews for Sarah and John on Friday"

**Q: What if I make a mistake?**
A: The bot always asks for confirmation before making changes. If something goes wrong, just ask it to fix it: "Oops, cancel that"

**Q: Can it see private notes?**
A: The bot sees the same information you do in Ashby. If you can see it, the bot can see it.

**Q: How do I apply someone to multiple jobs?**
A: Just ask! "Apply [candidate] to [job 1], [job 2], and [job 3]"

**Q: What if a candidate matches multiple people?**
A: The bot will show you all matches with emails and ask you to clarify.
